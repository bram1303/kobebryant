 <p class="lyrics">
  I want to be the best</br >
 I want to be the best, simple and plain</br>
 That's why I play the game</br>
 And to be the best you have to win</br>
 And that's what drives me</br>
 [Intro: Stephen A. Smith]</br>
 He's the best player in the game</br>
 It's just that simple</br>
 There's nothing that Kobe Bryant can't do</br>
 He will defend your best player</br>
 He will shoot from the perimeter</br>
 He will get all in yo' mug</br>
 He will do whatever it takes</br>
 He is the most complete basketball player</br>
 In the game today - bar none</br>
 He has an assassin's mentality</br>
 I said this week, I said this when the trade went down</br>
 And I will repeat it again</br>
 Who's starving more for an NBA World Championship</br>
 More than Kobe Bryant</br>
 There is no one</br>
 This guy is highly motivated</br>
 What separates Kobe from the pack</br>
 More than Kobe Bryant, there is no one</br>
